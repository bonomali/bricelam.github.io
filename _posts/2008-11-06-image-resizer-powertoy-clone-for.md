I just released another version of my [Image Resizer PowerToy Clone for Windows][1]. Thanks to [a feature request by
rshelq][2], the quality of images has been drastically improved. Would you believe it, that little tool is up to 10,209
total downloads. Its popularity just keeps growing. It has averaged 90 downloads per day in the past three months. It'll
be exciting to see [where it goes from here][3].

Rshelq also stated that the quality is, "now better than the software which you set out to clone!"
