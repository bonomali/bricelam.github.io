I just wanted to give a quick update and let everyone know that [Image Resizer 2.1.1][1] was released today. Head on
over to the [downloads page][2] to get it now.

I'm getting serious about version 3 of the utility, and I wanted to get a few of the community-contributed features out
to the public before I started changing everything. The features in this release include the following.

* Progress bar (by [w3seek][3]
* German translation (by [w3seek][3])
* French translation (by [vince38][4])

The setup is still in English, but after installing, if you're using a French or German version of Windows, things
should be in your native language.

Thanks for all your support!
