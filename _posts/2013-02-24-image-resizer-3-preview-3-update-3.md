That's right, I just released a third minor update to [Image Resizer 3 Preview 3][1]. This one fixes a bug in the
context menu handler that was causing problems with some other extensions. The update also includes some community
translations to French and German.

Behind the scenes, this version also puts me in a good position to start tackling the remaining features that I have
scheduled for version 3.
