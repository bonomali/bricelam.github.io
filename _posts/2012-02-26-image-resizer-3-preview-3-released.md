I just released another version of my [Image Resizer][1]. Here's a screenshot.

As you can see, there are a couple of new features. You can select a resize mode of either *Scale to* or *Stretch to*
(for those who don't care about maintaining the aspect ratio of their pictures). You can select a size unit of *Pixels*,
*Centimeters*, *Inches*, or *Percent*. The new *Ignore picture rotations* setting at the bottom is handy for resizing a
bunch of mixed-orientation pictures that you took with your camera. Before when you resized the portrait-oriented
pictures would end up being smaller than the landscape-oriented ones. With the new option checked, both landscape and
portrait pictures will end up being the same size.

There are also a few performance improvements and bug fixes in this release. For full details, be sure to check out the
[release page][2].

Happy resizing!
