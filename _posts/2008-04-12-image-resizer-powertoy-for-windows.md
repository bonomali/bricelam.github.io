Remember that wonderful Image Resizer PowerToy Microsoft released for Windows XP?  I have recreated it and now it will
also work on Windows Visa! This is an incredibly useful tool that allows you to mass-resize images just by
right-clicking on them. Click here to download [Image Resizer PowerToy for Windows Vista][1]. Enjoy!
