[ACS][1] had a lot of people come:

* Michelle Martin
* Lou Dibella
* Doug Barton
* Steve Gardanier
* David Carroll
* Steve McNamara

Lunch was by [Kneaders][2].

They ran out of food, so I went to [Panda Express][3] with Lannon. I was late to the presentation, but the speakers that
I heard gave us some really good advice. Concerning ACS though, I don't think I would want to work there. They're the
company that does work for gigantic corporations. That's not the kind of environment in which I want to work.

Oh, the best part of all is that they brought a bunch of stress balls and stress footballs.
