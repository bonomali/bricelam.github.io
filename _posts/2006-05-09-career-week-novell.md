This week is career week at [Neumont University][1]. This means that at noon every day this week we'll have the
opportunity to listen to a guest speaker from some big-name company. Oh, and the best part of all - **free lunch**!

Alan Clark and Cheryl Williams came to speak to us about some of the things that go on at [Novell][2]. I really liked
their outlook on the future. Novell is highly involved in the open source and open standards community. In fact, Alan
Clark's job is to be involved in a lot of the major standards organizations.

Oh, and for lunch it was pizza from [The Pie][3]. It was good.
