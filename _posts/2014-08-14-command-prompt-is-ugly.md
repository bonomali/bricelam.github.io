title: Command Prompt is Ugly
---

As a developer, I spend a fair amount of time in Command Prompt. Let's face it, it's ugly.

![Command Prompt]({{ "/attachments/CommandPromptOriginal.png" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})

Luckily, all of the font, colors, and sizes are configurable. I use the following theme which, I think, looks
significantly better.

![Themed Command Prompt]({{ "/attachments/CommandPromptThemed.png" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})

Here are the registration entries you can use to apply it.

Save them to a .reg file and double-click it.
