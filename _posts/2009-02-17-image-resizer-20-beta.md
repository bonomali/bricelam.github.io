It's finally here - the moment you've all been waiting for. Last night, I released version 2.0 beta of my [Image Resizer
Powertoy Clone for Windows][1]. The most notable new feature is 64-bit support.

This project was a lot of fun because it was my first production-quality C++ application. The code could still use a lot
of optimization and error handling, but I'm happy with my work.

I have tested this version on Windows XP, Windows Vista x64, and yes, even Windows 7 x64. Support for pre-XP versions
will be coming in the 2.0 final version, but if you actually need it for versions of Windows that old, I suggest
upgrading!

The new version can be downloaded from [here][2].
