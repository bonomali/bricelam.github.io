In case anyone missed it, I released a [second preview of Image Resizer 3][1]. I wanted to get the existing bits as
stable as possible so I fixed a few bugs and created a setup bootstrapper so there is no longer separate 32-bit and
64-bit installers. The main feature I added was multi-threaded resizing so now all those powerful cores on you computer
can be used for resizing.

I set this release as the default download since it is as stable as version 2 was with all of its features. I'm going to
start taking slices from the version 3 backlog and hopefully get new drops out about every three months.

Enjoy!
