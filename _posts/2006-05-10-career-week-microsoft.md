![Microsoft]({{ "/attachments/microsoft.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})

Today, [Chris Henley][1] of [Microsoft][2] came and spoke to us during lunch. His speach was very interesting. He is a
very passionate guy with a good set of values. He had a lot of great things to say about Microsoft as a company. I am
definitely keeping the option of Microsoft as a career open for my future.

Lunch was tacos from Gecko's Mexican Grill.
