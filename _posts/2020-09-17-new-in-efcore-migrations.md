This week on the [Entity Framework Community Standup](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oX0ObHwBrJ0vJpZ7PiYMqeA), I demoed all the new features (and even some old ones) that we've added to Migrations in EF Core 5.0. Be sure to check it out along with all the other great episodes like [Many-to-Many in EF Core 5.0](https://youtu.be/W1sxepfIMRM?t=287&list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oX0ObHwBrJ0vJpZ7PiYMqeA) with @ajcvickers.
