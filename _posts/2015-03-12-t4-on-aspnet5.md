title: T4 on ASP.NET Core
tags: t4
---

If you use Visual Studio, then you've probably crossed path with the [Text Template Transformation Toolkit][1] (or T4).
For those who aren't familiar with it, it's a fairly straight-forward templating engine built into Visual Studio. The
recent work on ASP.NET Core to enable cross-plaform web development, got me wondered what T4 might look like in this
enviroment. Last weekend, I started hacking on [Bricelam.TextTemplating][2], a T4 implementation for ASP.NET Core.

Writing
=======
You write templates [the same way][3] as before. For example, the following `VersionGenerator.tt` file could be used to
generate a C# file containing an `AssemblyFileVersion` attribute.

    <#
        var version = GenerateVersion(
            major: 1,
            minor: 0,
            epoch: new DateTime(2000, 1, 1));
    #>
    using System.Reflection;

    [assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("<#= version #>")]
    <#+
        Version GenerateVersion(int major, int minor, DateTime epoch)
        {
            var now = DateTime.UtcNow;
            var today = new DateTime(now.Year, now.Month, now.Day);

            var build = (int)(today - epoch).TotalDays;
            var revision = (int)(now - today).TotalSeconds / 2;

            return new Version(major, minor, build, revision);
        }
    #>

Transforming
============
To transform a template, you'll need to add the following to your `project.json` file.

```json
{
    "dependencies": {
        "Bricelam.TextTemplating": "1.0.0-*"
    },
    "commands": {
        "t4": "Bricelam.TextTemplating"
    }
}
```

Design-Time
-----------
To transform a template at design-time, use the following command.

```
k t4
```

This will produce a `VersionGenerator.cs` file with contents similar to the following.

```cs
using System.Reflection;

[assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("1.0.5548.41276")]
```

Build-time
----------
If you want to run the transform every time you build, add the following to your `project.json` file.

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "prebuild": [
            "dnx project.json t4"
        ]
    }
}
```

Runtime
-------
To create a runtime (or preprocessed) template, use the following command.

```
k t4 --preprocess
```

This will generate a `VersionGenerator` class that you can use run the transform at runtime. Use it with code similar to
the following.

```cs
var template = new VersionGenerator();
var output = template.TransformText();

Console.WriteLine(output);
```

As a Service
------------
You can also transform arbitrary templates at runtime without preprocessing them using the ITextTemplating service. Here
is some code demonstrating how to do that.

```cs
var services = new ServiceCollection()
    .AddTextTemplating()
    .BuildServiceProvider();

var textTemplating = services.GetService<ITextTemplating>();

var template = "Today is: <#= DateTime.Today.ToString(\"D\") #>";
var output = textTemplating.ProcessTemplate(template);

Console.WriteLine(output);
```

A Work In Progress
==================
Like I said, this is just the result of a weekend of coding. There are plenty of bugs and missing features. Just look
at [all the issues][4]!

Like it? Hate it? Let me know.

Happy templating.
