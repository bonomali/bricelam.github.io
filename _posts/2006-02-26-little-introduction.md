Hello,

I'm Brice, I am currently living in South Jordan, Utah and going to school at [Neumont University][1]. I love developing
software, and have been doing so (in some form or another) since I was 12 years old. When I'm finished with schooling, I
hope to move to the Puget Sound area. I've never blogged before, so I can't say exactly what I'll post here, or even if
I'll post at all! But I'll try...

Until next time,  
Brice
